# SPC Processing Algorithms

This is a QGIS plugin adding some processing algorithms used at SPC.

It currently contains the following groups :
- `project` : a series of algorithms to work on qgs project files, including PDF exports
- `tcrm` : integration of the TCRM
- `utils` : small helper algorithms (e.g. text replace)
- `hacks` : replacement for core algorithms that are not usable currently for our workflows (while fix makes it into core)

This is work in progress and is highly unstable. It should only be used for testing purpose as the algorithm will most likely change.

## Installation

Download the source and install it from the QGIS plugin manager (using install from zip).
